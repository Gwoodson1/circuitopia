Planet Profiler
Country Comparator
World Trends

We constructed an gaming app that relates countries' data to one another. The premise of the app is that the user will guess whether one country's data point is higher than another countries for a variety of categories. 

Data was taken from Wikipedia for 198 Countries, in addition to the World Total. Some categories had limited information on countries.

The categories are the following: Population, Area (Total Area, not Landmass), Population Density, GDP (Nominal), HDI (Human Development Index), External Debt, CO2 Emissions per Year, Trade Balance (Value of Exports - Imports), Life Expectancy, Elevation (Highest Point, not Average), Military Expenditures (When Applicable, ~40 Countries), Average Wage (When Applicable, ~40 Countries), and Duration of National Anthem.



In the coding process, we used a mixture of html, css, and python with flask.
